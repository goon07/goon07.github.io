    <h1>PaDue Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 28, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
    <p>PaDue is dedicated to creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all users, with a particular focus on protecting children from harm. We unequivocally prohibit any form of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on our platform, including but not limited to the creation, dissemination, or facilitation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), grooming, sextortion, or trafficking. This policy reflects our compliance with Google Play’s Child Safety Standards, international laws (e.g., the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, EU Child Protection Directives), and our ethical responsibility to safeguard minors.</p>

    <h2>2. Scope of Prohibited Activities</h2>
    <p>We define CSAE broadly to ensure comprehensive protection. The following are strictly forbidden on PaDue:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation, sharing, solicitation, or promotion of CSAM, including explicit images, videos, text, or AI-generated content depicting minors.</li>
        <li>Grooming behaviors, such as attempts to build trust with minors for sexual exploitation or manipulation.</li>
        <li>Sextortion, including threats to distribute intimate images of minors for coercion or extortion.</li>
        <li>Human trafficking or exploitation of children for sexual purposes, including recruitment or solicitation.</li>
        <li>Any content or communication that sexualizes minors, even if not explicitly illegal (e.g., suggestive remarks or imagery).</li>
        <li>Attempts to circumvent our detection systems (e.g., encrypted files, coded language).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Enforcement Measures</h2>
    <p>PaDue employs a multi-layered approach to prevent and address CSAE:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Proactive Detection:</strong> We utilize advanced automated tools (e.g., machine learning, hash-matching via PhotoDNA) and human moderation to identify and block CSAE content before it spreads.</li>
        <li><strong>Swift Action:</strong> Upon detection or reporting, we immediately remove violating content and terminate the offending user’s account permanently.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Reporting:</strong> We report all identified CSAM and credible CSAE threats to the <a href="https://report.cybertip.org" target="_blank">National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)</a> via CyberTipline, as required by U.S. law (18 U.S.C. § 2258A), and cooperate fully with global law enforcement agencies.</li>
        <li><strong>User Bans:</strong> Offenders are banned from PaDue, with measures to prevent re-registration (e.g., device and IP tracking where legally permissible).</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> We regularly update our detection algorithms and train our moderation team to adapt to emerging CSAE tactics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Reporting Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>We empower our community to help us maintain safety:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In-App Reporting:</strong> Users can report suspected CSAE directly within PaDue via the “Report” feature, available on all user-generated content and profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Dedicated Contact:</strong> For detailed or urgent concerns, email us at <a href="mailto:childsafety@padue.twalitso.com">childsafety@info.twalitso.com</a>. Reports are prioritized and reviewed within 24 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>External Resources:</strong> For immediate threats, we encourage contacting local law enforcement or NCMEC (<a href="https://report.cybertip.org" target="_blank">https://report.cybertip.org</a> or 1-800-843-5678).</li>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Reporters’ identities are protected to the fullest extent allowed by law, encouraging good-faith reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Education and Prevention</h2>
    <p>PaDue goes beyond enforcement to foster a safe community:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Guidelines:</strong> Our Community Standards, accessible in-app and at [insert URL], explicitly outline acceptable behavior and consequences for CSAE violations.</li>
        <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> We provide in-app notifications and resources to educate users about recognizing and reporting CSAE.</li>
        <li><strong>Parental Tools:</strong> Where applicable, we offer settings to restrict minors’ interactions (e.g., disabling direct messaging for under-13 accounts if COPPA applies).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Compliance and Accountability</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Alignment:</strong> This policy complies with global regulations, including COPPA (U.S.), GDPR (EU), and the UK Online Safety Act, as well as Google Play’s Child Safety Standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We publish annual transparency reports detailing CSAE incidents and our response actions (starting 2026, available at [insert URL]).</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Audits:</strong> We engage independent experts to audit our CSAE prevention measures annually, ensuring accountability and effectiveness.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
